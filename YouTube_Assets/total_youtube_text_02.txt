ES Data Collectors used an AudioMoth device to record audio data, known as soundscapes, for 5 consecutive days during the April 8, 2024 total solar eclipse. Audio data from the time of the maximum phase, totality for those on the eclipse path, and that same time frame on the 2 days before and the 2 days after the eclipse, is shared publicly and openly on the ARISA Lab YouTube channel.  \n \n

The Eclipse Soundscapes Project is a NASA Citizen Science project funded by NASA Science Activation that is studying how eclipses affect life on Earth during the October 14, 2023 annular solar eclipse and the April 8, 2024 total solar eclipse. Eclipse Soundscapes will revisit an eclipse study from almost 100 years ago that showed that animals and insects are affected by solar eclipses! Like this study from 100 years ago, ES asks for the publicâ€™s help. ES uses modern technology to continue to study how solar eclipses affect life on Earth!

Eclipse Soundscapes is an enterprise of ARISA Lab, LLC and is supported by NASA award No. 80NSSC21M0008. \n \n
